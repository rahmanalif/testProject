# 🧲 Magnetic Polarity Test Game

A test project built in Unity demonstrating magnetic polarity-based mechanics, smooth movement, and basic obstacle interaction.

## 🎮 Description

This game showcases:

- A simple **player controller** with basic movement and jump.
- Automatic **magnetic polarity switching** every 3–5 seconds (Red ↔ Blue).
- Two types of **obstacles**:
  - Static blocks
  - Moving cylinders
- Obstacles have **fixed magnetic poles** (Red or Blue).
- The player is either **attracted or repelled** based on polarity interaction.
- The level ends upon reaching a **finish line** on the far right.

## ⚙️ Core Features

- ✅ Magnetic force calculations with polarity-based attraction/repulsion  
- ✅ Low jitter and smooth character movement using `CharacterController`  
- ✅ Fine-tuned jump system (coyote time, jump buffering, fall gravity)  
- ✅ Simple obstacle logic using Unity physics  
- ✅ Polarity color indicators via player material

## 🎯 Objective

Navigate through obstacles by mastering magnetic forces and reach the finish line while ensuring all core mechanics and physics behave as
